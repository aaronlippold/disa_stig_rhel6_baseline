  desc  "The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which
means that data from the login session, including passwords and all other
information transmitted during the session, can be stolen by eavesdroppers on
the network. The telnet protocol is also subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Mitigation:  If an enabled telnet daemon is configured to only allow
encrypted sessions, such as with Kerberos or the use of encrypted network
tunnels, the risk of exposing sensitive information is mitigated.
