  title "The system must require passwords to contain a minimum of 15
characters."
  desc  "Requiring a minimum password length makes password cracking attacks
more difficult by ensuring a larger search space. However, any security benefit
from an onerous requirement must be carefully weighed against usability
problems, support costs, or counterproductive behavior that may result.

    While it does not negate the password length requirement, it is preferable
to migrate from a password-based authentication scheme to a stronger one based
on PKI (public key infrastructure).
