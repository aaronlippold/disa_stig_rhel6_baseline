# chkconfig \"qpidd\" --list

Output should indicate the \"qpidd\" service has either not been installed, or
has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig \"qpidd\" --list
\"qpidd\" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify \"qpidd\" is disabled through current
runtime configuration:

# service qpidd status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:

qpidd is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding."
