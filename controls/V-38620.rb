  title "The system clock must be synchronized continuously, or at least daily."
  desc  "Enabling the \"ntpd\" service ensures that the \"ntpd\" service will
be running and that the system will synchronize its time to any servers
specified. This is important whether the system is configured to be a client
(and synchronize only its own clock) or it is also acting as an NTP server to
other systems. Synchronizing time is essential for authentication services such
as Kerberos, but it is also important for maintaining accurate logs and
auditing possible security breaches."
