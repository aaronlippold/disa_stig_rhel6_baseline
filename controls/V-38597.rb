  title "The system must limit the ability of processes to have simultaneous
write and execute access to memory."
  desc  "ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as a
limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be executed, on
a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory regions such as
the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware prevents execution in
that address range."
