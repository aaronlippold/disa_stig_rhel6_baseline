boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig \"oddjobd\" --list

Output should indicate the \"oddjobd\" service has either not been installed,

# chkconfig \"oddjobd\" --list
\"oddjobd\" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify \"oddjobd\" is disabled through current
runtime configuration:

# service oddjobd status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:

oddjobd is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding."
