  desc 'check', "Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection
application is loaded on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080 the preferred intrusion
detection system is McAfee HBSS available through Cybercom.

If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as
SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.

Procedure:
Examine the system to see if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is
installed:

# rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm

Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i \"hipclient\"

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion
detection system:

# find / -name <daemon name>

Where <daemon name> is the name of the primary application daemon to determine
if the application is loaded on the system.

Determine if the application is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i <daemon name>

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion
detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.

If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the
system, this is a finding.
"
  desc 'fix', "Install and enable the latest McAfee HIPS package, available from

If the system does not support the McAfee HIPS package, install and enable a
supported intrusion detection system application and document its use with the
Authorizing Official.
