  desc 'fix', "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption
through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The
easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.

For manual installations, select the \"Encrypt\" checkbox during partition
creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will
prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will
subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by
adding the \"--encrypted\" and \"--passphrase=\" options to the definition of
each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt
the root partition:

part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted
--passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]

Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the \"--passphrase=\" option from
the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively
ask for the passphrase during installation.

Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on the
Red Hat Documentation web site:

https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-LUKS_Disk_Encryption.html"
