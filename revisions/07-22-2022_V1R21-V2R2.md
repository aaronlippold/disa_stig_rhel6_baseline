The following command will list which files and directories on
the system have permissions different from what is expected by the RPM
database:

# rpm -Va  | grep '^.M'

If there is any output, for each file or directory found, find the associated
RPM package and compare the RPM-expected permissions with the actual
permissions on the file or directory:

# rpm -qf [file or directory name]
# rpm -q --queryformat "[%{FILENAMES} %{FILEMODES:perms}]" [package] | grep  [filename]
# ls -dlL [filename]

If the existing permissions are more permissive than those expected by RPM,
this is a finding.

```

The status of the "net.ipv4.ip_forward" kernel parameter can
be queried by running the following command:

$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

The output of the command should indicate a value of "0". If this value is
not the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime,
and verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".

$ grep net.ipv4.ip_forward /etc/sysctl.conf

The ability to forward packets is only appropriate for routers. If the correct
value is not returned, this is a finding. 

```

Updated:
```
The status of the "net.ipv4.ip_forward" kernel parameter can be queried by running the following command:

$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

$ grep net.ipv4.ip_forward /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

If "net.ipv4.ip_forward" is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out or does not have a value of "0", this is a finding.

To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
"settimeofday" system call, run the following command:

$ sudo grep -w "settimeofday" /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.

If the system is not configured to audit time changes, this is a finding. 

```

Updated:
```
To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the "settimeofday" system call, run the following command:

$ sudo grep -w "settimeofday" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S settimeofday -k audit_time_rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S settimeofday -k audit_time_rules

If the system is 64-bit and does not return a rule for both "b32" and "b64" architectures, this is a finding.

If the system is not configured to the "settimeofday" syscall, this is a finding.

The status of the "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route"
kernel parameter can be queried by running the following command:

$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route

The output of the command should indicate a value of "0". If this value is
not the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime,
and verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".

$ grep net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route /etc/sysctl.conf

If the correct value is not returned, this is a finding.

Updated:

The status of the "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route" kernel parameter can be queried by running the following command:

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

$ grep net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

If "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route" is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out or does not have a value of "0", this is a finding.

The status of the "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" kernel
parameter can be queried by running the following command:

not the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime,
and verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".

$ grep net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects /etc/sysctl.conf

If the system is 64-bit only, this is not applicable.

To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the "stime" system
call, run the following command:

$ sudo grep -w "stime" /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.

If the system is not configured to audit time changes, this is a finding.

have permissions different from what is expected by the RPM database:

If there is any output, for each file or directory found, compare the
RPM-expected permissions with the permissions on the file or directory:

# rpm -q --queryformat "[%{FILENAMES} %{FILEMODES:perms}]" audit | grep  [filename]

Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection
application is loaded on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080 the preferred intrusion
detection system is McAfee HBSS available through Cybercom.

If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as
SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.

Procedure:
Examine the system to see if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is
installed:

# rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm

Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i "hipclient"

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion
detection system:

# find / -name <daemon name>

Where <daemon name> is the name of the primary application daemon to determine
if the application is loaded on the system.

Determine if the application is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i <daemon name>

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion
detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.

If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the
system, this is a finding.

All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the
system should be explicitly listed in "/etc/fstab" by an administrator. New
filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.

    The "autofs" daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home
directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to
handle removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device
as "/misc/cd". However, this method of providing access to removable media is
not common, so autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even
if NFS is required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts
statically by editing "/etc/fstab" rather than relying on the automounter.

Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.
